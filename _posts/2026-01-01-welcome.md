excerpt: "A living space for insights, experiments, and lessons learned building with AI."
---

This site is an experiment in working with the garage door up.

I'm Derek Colling, VP of Creative at an animal health marketing agency. I spend my days leading creative strategy for veterinary brands and my nights building AI-powered systems that make creative work more effective.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't a polished portfolio. It's a living workspace.

I'll share:

- **Insights on AI adoption**: What actually works vs. what gets hyped
- **Marketing patterns**: Platform arbitrage, creative strategy, agency dynamics
- **Tool evaluations**: Honest takes on AI tools and workflows
- **Lessons learned**: Building systems like Agency OS that blend human creativity with AI capability

## The Philosophy

Start small. Crawl before you walk. Build one working system before adding the next.

Most people fail with AI because they try to transform everything at once. The pattern that works: stack small wins until transformation becomes invisible.

## Why Now

We're in a unique moment where AI tools are powerful enough to be genuinely useful but early enough that most people haven't figured out how to use them well.

The gap between what people think works and what actually works is massive. That gap is interesting.

## What's Next

I'll convert X threads into longer posts. Share case studies from client work (anonymized). Document how Agency OS works. Review tools honestly.

No schedule. No growth hacks. Just insights when they're worth sharing.

If you want to follow along, I'm [@derekcolling](https://x.com/derekcolling) on X.

Let's see where this goes.
