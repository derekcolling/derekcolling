# About

I'm Derek Colling, VP of Creative at an animal health marketing agency where I lead creative strategy, brand development, and campaign execution for veterinary and animal health brands.

## What I Do

My work sits at the intersection of creative direction and AI-powered workflows. I build systems that amplify human creativity rather than replace it. This includes custom AI agents, workflow automation, and knowledge management systems that help creative teams move faster without sacrificing quality.

## Experience

**VP of Creative** at animal health marketing agency (current)
- Leading creative strategy for veterinary and animal health brands
- Building AI-enhanced creative workflows
- Managing cross-functional creative teams

## How I Think

I believe in starting small with AI adoption. Crawl before you walk. Build muscle memory with one tool, one workflow at a time. The people who master AI aren't the ones who adopt fastest. They're the ones who stack small wins until transformation becomes invisible.

I'm skeptical of hype, interested in patterns, and focused on what actually works.
